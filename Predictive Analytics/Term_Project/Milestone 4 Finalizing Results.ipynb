    "Since antiquity, games have been an integral aspect of human society – especially for cultural development and social interaction. With the advancement of human civilization, the way games are being played has drastically changed over the eons as modern games are primarily played electronically (video games). With over 3 billion players worldwide and approximately 200 billion dollars in revenue, the video gaming industry is constantly looking to attract new customers and boost playtime. As a result, we will implement a collaborative recommendation system to assist users in finding similar games that may interest them. By utilizing a collaborative filtering system, we can use historical review information to determine whether a product might interest one of our customers. We will experiment with two approaches to determine which application would be better for an e-commerce implementation.  "

    "Our first approach will implement memory-based collaborative filtering, which utilizes the collective review information of other users to find similar games. We’ll be implementing both item-item and user-item methods to determine which provides a better result for our users. These two methods offer predictions based on what similar users like and what users who like a particular game are likely to enjoy. We’ll use several distance measurement algorithms to determine which provides a more accurate recommendation such as: cosine similarity, Pearson Correlation, and K-nearest neighbors. The models created using these methods should perform fastest while providing acceptable accuracy.  For our model-based collaborative filtering, we will train a few machine learning (ML) algorithms to make recommendations and find similar games. Our project will focus on utilizing matrix factorization algorithms to make this determination but will be looking to implement a deep learning approach given the time. The process of applying different ML algorithms is fairly simple, so we’ll be looking to implement the most we can: SVD, PMF, and NMF, then compare our results with the memory-based results.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  Our second approach to creating a recommendation system for our games library is by implementing a content-based filtering system utilizing natural language processing and available user reviews. This process will use a vectorized matrix of user reviews to find games that have been reviewed in a similar way. We can implement many of the techniques from our memory-based collaborative filtering process into this one and measure performance across each of our distance-measuring algorithms.  We can utilize a standard train-test methodology from many of the of the models we will be implementing while cross referencing our suggested games with user-rated games.  We also have user information in our data set as to whether they would make a recommendation for the game they are reviewing.  We can utilize this data in testing our results accuracy. "
