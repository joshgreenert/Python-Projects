    "Based on the data that were provided, I decided to use a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to generate predictions based on how close the ratings were with each respective movie title.  Once the list of movies were collected, I looped through the results and created a link — using the links dataset — on the \"tmdbId\" column to allow the user to easily navigate to the movie suggestion for review.  Based on the tests shown above with the movies \"Toy Story\", \"Toy Story 2\", and \"Fight Club\", we can easily see that the model has fairly decent accuracy in terms of recommendations.  For instance, the test on \"Toy STory\" and \"Toy Story 2\" both reference one another, as they should, along with other movies that fall into either a children's movie theme or an action/adventure theme.  Alternatively, the suggestions for \"Fight Club\" match a darker theme of movie with mentions such as \"Kill Bill\" and \"American History X\".  Overall, the KNN recommendation model shows promise in generating accurate and relevant movie suggestions based on user input, while also providing links to the recommended movies for user perusal. "
