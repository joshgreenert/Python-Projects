# Programming Assignment Week 9

#
# For this week we will modify our Gettysburg processing program from week 8 in order to generate a 
# text file from the output rather than printing to the screen. Your program should have a new function 
# called process_file which prints to the file (this method should almost be the same as the pretty_print 
# function from last week. Keep in mind that we have print statements in main as well. Your program must 
# modify the print statements from main as well.


# Your program must have a header. 
# Your program should adhere to PEP8 guidelines especially as it pertains to variable names.
# Create a new function called process_fie. This function will perform the same operations as pretty_print from week 8 however it will print to a file instead of to the screen.
# Modify your main method to print the length of the dictionary to the file as opposed to the screen.
# This will require that you open the file twice. Once in main and once in process_file.
# Prompt the user for the filename they wish to use to generate the report.
# Use the filename specified by the user to write the file.
# This will require you to pass the file as an additional parameter to your new process_file function.
